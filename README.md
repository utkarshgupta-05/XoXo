# 🧠 How the Application Works (End to End)

1. Player opens the application and enters their **name**.
2. They either **create a room** (receiving a unique 6-character room code) or **join** an existing room using a friend's code.
3. Both players enter a waiting room where live Bitmoji-style avatars display their online/offline status.
4. Once both players are connected, they enter the game screen where either player can choose who moves first or use the **🎲 Random** option.
5. The player going first becomes **🔵 Circle (O)**, while the second player becomes **❤️ Heart (X)**.
6. Every move is synchronized instantly through **Firebase Realtime Database**.
7. After a win or draw, the persistent scoreboard updates automatically.
8. To begin another round, both players must agree to a rematch.
9. Players can send messages anytime through the built-in real-time chat widget.
10. Refreshing the page automatically reconnects players to their room using LocalStorage.
11. Firebase Presence keeps track of online/offline status.
12. Rooms remain available for up to **1 hour of inactivity**, after which they are automatically removed.
